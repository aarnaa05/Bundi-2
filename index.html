            <p>Within the indigo weave of these narrow lanes, every soul moves in a shared cadence. Here, the home extends past the threshold, and the street is a collective courtyard. Through the maze of shop-houses, the boundary between private and public dissolves; families spill onto the stones to talk, trade, and socialize. In Bundi, neighbors are kin - a single family where every narrow lane is an open home.</p>
